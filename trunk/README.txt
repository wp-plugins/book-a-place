Booking places, seats, tickets… In theatres, cinemas, restaurants etc. It’s really convenient, when people are able to book a place online. With our plugin it’s possible.

Book a Place plugin is very easy to use by both parties: users, who want to book a place, and administrators, who create a scheme, add places, set prices etc. We created our plugin as simple as possible. And we are ready to continue working on it to make it better.

1. Upload Book a Place plugin to your blog (/wp-content/plugins/).
1. Activate it through the administration panel.

= How to =

1. You should go to Schemes section and create a new scheme there. Scheme is just a scheme of your theatre, cinema or restaurant. There you should input name, description, width and height.

Name is just a name.
In description you should describe the event, mention the date and time and other important info.
Width – number of cells horizontally. In each cell you will be able to set a place. Each cell is like a 1 square meter.
Height – number of cells vertically.

Are you confused now? Don’t worry, we are almost there :)

1. Now you should find your scheme in listing and click on View.
1. Here you can set places, prices etc. Use colors to group similar things. Create different places using several cells.
1. You can find a shortcode for each scheme in Schemes section. This shortcode can be embedded to any post or page.

That’s it! Now everybody can book a place. You will get an email about this as administrator and user will get an email too. Email templates can be edited in Settings section (‘E-mail templates’ tab). In section Orders administrator will find information about all orders.
